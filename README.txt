## Current Projects

### Greenko Transport Carbon Emissions Dashboard
A web application that analyzes logistics data to calculate carbon emissions for transportation activities. The application processes data from PRL-GreenkoReport-24-25.csv/xlsx to:
- Calculate carbon emissions for each vehicle trip based on distance, load weight, and efficiency
- Compare on-time vs. delayed deliveries and quantify excess emissions due to delays
- Provide detailed emissions breakdowns by vehicle, consignee, and trip
- Identify opportunities for emissions reduction in the logistics chain
